How to Get Anything You Want
============================

For many years of my life, there was a dull hum in the background of my inner monologue. It wasn’t loud, but it was powerful. I wasn’t even conscious of it most of the time, but my actions and daily decisions were guided by it. 

What I realize now, is that there was a voice inside of me that said, _“You can’t do that. You don’t measure up. Look at how successful those around you are. You’ll never be as good as that.”_ 

Even though it was background noise, it had a negative effect on my life. It kept me from taking more risks, it held me back from doing everything I could to make my dreams a reality. 

When I started a business in the mid-2000s, that ugly voice pre-destined that it wasn’t going to work out. It told me that I wasn’t enough to make it happen.

**NONE OF THAT WAS TRUE.** But that business failure came into being anyway because my mindset ensured that was going to be the result. My business failed and for several years I blamed external things. It was the economy, it was the market I was trying to jump into, it was other people letting me down. But that wasn’t true either – at its core, it was my mindset that determined the outcome. That “not good enough” mindset kept me from doing the exact things I needed to do to get success. It told me that it wasn’t going to happen no matter how hard I worked. 

It seems mystical and fluffy – but it is as real as anything you can hold in your hand. 

The words we use to talk to ourselves are the most important words in the universe.

Henry Ford said, _“Whether you think you can, or you think you can’t–you’re right.”_ 

Your mindset determines your outcome. 

Having a mindset that communicates to your innermost fiber that says _“You can do it – you can persevere – you can have anything you want”_ is extremely powerful. 

That doesn’t mean you won’t have to overcome adversity. Or that everything will be easy. Nope – that’s not true at all. But when you maintain a mindset that you are powerful and that you can persevere in the face of challenges, then you’re on the path to a great achievement. It might not happen when you want or how you’ve planned it all out, but with an unbreakable mindset, you can achieve anything. Really – anything!

What are the things your inner monologue is telling you right now? Are they positive words or are they dragging you down? 

Take the time to listen to them – no matter how quiet or loud they are. Decide right now to make a habit that when you tell yourself something negative, you replace it with something positive. The more you replace negativity with empowering words, the more you will produce positive results in your life. 

Today can be the day it all turns around. And it starts with you deciding you’re good enough as you are.
