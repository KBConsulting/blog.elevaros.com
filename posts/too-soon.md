Too Soon!
=========

If you’ve spent any time in IT, you’ve likely been a part of a significant change that either introduces a new system or replaces an existing one.

Change is difficult – even the simplest difference in a process or how a system works can result in challenges. However, one tricky issue that befalls larger projects is the inability to sustain motivation throughout all phases of a project.

In a recent enterprise cloud migration, I experienced this first-hand. Over the first couple of phases, some of the most difficult hurdles were traversed, and the team celebrated – and rightly so! The early work was challenging, and we were right to enjoy the glow of accomplishment. But an unfortunate side effect was that the team developed a mild hubris about the project and lost the intense drive and focus we had at the outset. As a result, the project lost momentum, and it seemed to go on endlessly- well past its initially targeted completion date.

If your answer to this is, ‘_Then don’t celebrate until the end!_‘, to quote the principal in the movie **Billy Madison**, “_I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul._“
