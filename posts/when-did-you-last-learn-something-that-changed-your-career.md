When Did You Last Learn Something That Changed Your Career?
===========================================================

It’s been a while since I reviewed the ELEVAROS foundational model. I last wrote about it in April – but this time, I made a video to help you understand and apply it to your life. 

I created this model after surveying over 200 “tech-adjacent” people – those who work closely with I.T. workers. I asked them a series of questions to find the answer to, _“What is the difference between a good technologist, and the best one you have ever worked with?”_

The results were _staggering_. I knew there would be a lot of “soft skills” mentioned. What I didn’t expect was that NOT ONE respondent would answer that question with “tech skills.” No one said, “They’re the best at Cloud Infrastructure Services,” or “They write the cleanest, most efficient code.” It was all about other _non-technical_ skills.

I took that feedback and searched for the underlying principles: and they all fell under one of two areas: **Understanding Others** and **Self-Management.**

The difference between a GOOD technologist and _THE BEST_ is all about your non-technical abilities. If you can develop better ‘Self-Management’ skills and increase your capacity to ‘Understand Others’, there will be no limit to the things you can do in your career. It seems so simple, but from my experience in tech, we tend to layer on more and more technical skills and neglect the others.
