The thinking I've done about this is pretty minimal but I need to dedicate some time to it this week while I am out in Washington visiting Rachel. I think that any collaboration is out: I feel strongly that this should be a solo venture. However, that may be difficult and it is probably highly influenced by the disaster that occurred with Alex. That's not really fair to Alex Swallow, whom I have a meeting with next Tuesday to discuss potential working arrangements. I really don't want to have that call nor do I want to tell him I'm really not interested in working with him. So I'm making decisions based on a previous (current?) issue that will likely limit me. But I really don't want to work with anyone else - I want to do this completely solo. I don't know that I can trust myself with that though - this is such a raw time.
